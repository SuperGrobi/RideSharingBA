This is nearly all the code I wrote for my bachelors thesis.
Most of the folder contain simulation scripts, that can be used to generate the data used to plot the figures in the thesis.
Some folders contain legacy code and some folder either contain plotting scripts or simulations I ran specifically for plots.
most of these files are barely documented, although probably in great parts self explanatory.
The main three files of interest are:
"ring_np_num.jl", "average_detour.jl" and "load_and_process.jl" the first one contains all the code to run simulations of your own,
the second one contains the code to generate the theoretical predictions for the n-player case and the last one provides some utilities
to load and process simulation files.
I tried to document these as well as possible.
