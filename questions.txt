- how does the amount of peaks depend on: cutoff angle, player count, discount, detour scale
- how does the width of peaks depend on: cutoff angle, player count, discount, detour scale
- how many requested shared rides are actually shared

- many players, high start value: does this occur without cutoff?

- how does the time evolution of a starting probability look like? (make nice plots...)
